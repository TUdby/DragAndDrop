This program DOES NOT run from the command line.
To make it run, do the following steps:

1) open eclipse
2) start a new java project
3) link in the amazon aws libraries
4) creat a package within src named "DragAndDrop"
5) bring DragDropFiles.java into the DragAndDrop package
6) open the file and run from eclipse

as long as the AWS credentials are up to date and
in the correct place, this will run the code.
